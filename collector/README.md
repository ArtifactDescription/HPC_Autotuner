### 2. Select a scenario and setup the environment
- If the scenario for ADIOS1-coupled applications is selected, follow README in the directory adios1-coupled to setup the environment.
- If the scenario for ADIOS2-coupled applications is selected, follow README in the directory adios2-coupled to setup the environment.

For example, 
```
cd adios2-coupled
./build.sh
source env.sh
```

### 2. Inputs
In each input file including configurations to be measured, each line is one configuration and each column is one parameter value separated by '\t'.

The input file for each application/workflow: 
The number of samples of lmp/vr/lv/lvi to be measured is set in the file exp_lv/num_smpl.txt .
- lmp: each line includes (#process, PPN, #thread per process, #iterations per output) in the file exp_lv/smpl_lmp.csv. 
- vr: each line includes (#process, PPN, #thread per process) in the file exp_lv/smpl_vr.csv.
- lv: each line includes (lmp--#process, lmp--PPN, lmp--#thread per process, lmp--#iterations per output, vr--#process, vr--PPN, vr--#thread per process) in the file exp_lv/smpl_lv.csv.
- lvi: each line includes (#iterations in the phase from liquid to solid, #iterations in the solid phase, lmp--#process, lmp--PPN, lmp--#thread per process, lmp--#iterations per output, vr--#process, vr--PPN, vr--#thread per process) in the file lv/smpl_lvi.csv.

The number of samples of ht/sw/hs/hsi to be measured is set in the file exp_hs/num_smpl.txt .
- ht: each line includes (#process in X, #process in Y, PPN, #outputs, buffer size) in the file hs/smpl_ht.csv.
- sw: each line includes (#process, PPN) in the file hs/smpl_sw.csv.
- hs: each line includes (ht--#process in X, ht--#process in Y, ht--PPN, ht--#outputs, ht--buffer size, sw--#process, sw--PPN) in the file hs/smpl_hs.csv.
- hsi: each line includes (X dimension size, Y dimension size, #iterations, ht--#process in X, ht--#process in Y, ht--PPN, ht--#outputs, ht--buffer size, sw--#process, sw--PPN) in the file hs/smpl_hsi.csv.

The number of samples of gs/pdf/pplot/gplot to be measured is set in the file exp_bp4/num_smpl.txt .
The number of samples of gp/gpv/gv/wf to be measured is set in the file exp_bp4/num_smpl.txt .
- gs: each line includes (edge length of a cube, #simulation steps, #process, PPN) in the file bp4/smpl_gs.csv.
- pdf: each line includes (edge length of a cube, #simulation steps, #process, PPN) in the file bp4/smpl_pdf.csv.
- pplot/gplot: each line includes (edge length of a cube, #simulation steps) in the file bp4/smpl_plot.csv.
- gp/gpv/wf: each line includes (edge length of a cube, #simulation steps, gs--#process, gs--PPN, pdf--#process, pdf--PPN) in the file sst/smpl_gp.csv.
- gv: each line includes (edge length of a cube, #simulation steps, gs--#process, gs--PPN) in the file sst/smpl_gv.csv.

To run an analysis/visualization application separately, the data generated by the simulation is required to be placed in the directories exp_lv, exp_hs, exp_bp4 for LV, HS, and GP, respectively.
the data generated by lmp, ht, gs, and pdf are the inputs of vr, sw, pdf/gplot, and pplot, respectively.
- lmp-xxxx/dump.bp and lmp-bpxxxx/dump.bp.dir/dump.bp.[number] (xx is #iterations per output) are generated by LAMMPS.
- ht-xx/heat.bp (xx is #outputs) are generated by Heat-transfer.
- gs-xxxx-yyy/gs.bp/data.[number] (xxxx is edge length of a cube and yyy is #simulation steps) are generated by Gray-Scott.
- pdf-xxxx-yyy/pdf.bp/data.[number] (xxxx is edge length of a cube and yyy is #simulation steps) are generated by PDF Calculator.

### 3. Launch the collector
```
./workflow [App/Workflow_Name] [No_of_Nodes] [Experiment_ID]
```
- [App/Workflow_Name] is listed above;
- [No_of_Nodes] is the number of computing nodes requested;
- [Experiment_ID] should be a unique ID for each experiment.

For example, 
```
./workflow wf 6 wf1
```

### 4. Collect the measured configuration-performance samples
```
./collect.sh [Experiment_ID] [No_of_Components]
```
The path of collect.sh is 
- For LAMMPS, Voro++, LV, Heat-transfer, Stage-write, and HS: collector/collect.sh
- For Gray-Scott, PDF Calculator, PDF Plot, Gray Plot: collector/bp4/collect.sh
- For any applications coupled from Gray-Scott, PDF Calculator, PDF Plot, and Gray Plot: collector/sst/collect.sh

The collected data is in Experiment_ID/time_list.csv .

For example,
```
./collect.sh wf1 4
```
